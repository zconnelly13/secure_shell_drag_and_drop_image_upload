Secure Shell Drag and Drop Image Uploader
=========================================

This is a customized version of the Secure Shell chrome extension found here (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo?hl=en)

It allows you to drag-and-drop images into the terminal.

It will upload the image to imgur, wget it, and rename it to [image_name]_[width]_[height].png
